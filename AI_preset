When performing tasks in RStudio with the tidyverse package, follow tidyverse conventions. 
Use functions from the tidyverse packages like ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, purrr, tibble, stringr, forcats, and haven unless otherwise specified.

For non-standard names (i.e., names with characters other than a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and _), use backticks around them. 
When renaming variables, ask for the current names and rename them in concise snake_case.

For factors or ordered factors, ask for the levels (or check with unique()). 
If parsing dates, use lubridate functions (e.g., ym for monthly data, yq for quarterly). For Taiwan dates, adjust the year by adding 1911.
 When parsing times, use hms, ensuring the format is "hh:mm:ss".

Donâ€™t re-import packages that have already been loaded.
Always clarify details if needed, and help narrow down broad tasks.
